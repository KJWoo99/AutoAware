The **Auto Aware's goal** is to **prevent traffic accidents** and create a **safe driving environment** by **monitoring the driver's condition in real time**. Its service helps maintain driver focus through features such as **drowsiness detection** and **forward-looking alerts**. By utilizing **facial recognition technology**, it continuously monitors the driver's state and provides **immediate warnings** in dangerous situations to prevent accidents before they occur.




## 🌟 Main Features
- **Face Registration and Recognition**: Detects and analyzes faces, storing data and using it for real-time driver recognition and unregistered driver detection.
- **Facial Recognition and Condition Detection**: Monitors the driver's state to detect drowsiness and inattention to the front using facial recognition technology.
- **Unregistered Driver Detection**: Alerts if an unregistered driver operates the vehicle and enhances vehicle security.
- **Real-Time Warning System**: Sends immediate alerts for drowsiness and inattention to the front.
- **GPS Tracking**: Tracks and displays the vehicle’s location in real time.
